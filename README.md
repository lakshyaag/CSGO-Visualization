# CSGO Visualization

Steps to use the app:

1. Downloaded the required demo from HLTV
2. Run the `parser.ipynb` notebook, specifying the folder name containing the map demos. The notebook will take care of appending all maps in a match and will provide `.csv` files for multiple metrics
3. Upload the `grenades.csv` file in the [Shiny app](https://lakshyaag.shinyapps.io/CSGO-Visualization/) and use as needed!
